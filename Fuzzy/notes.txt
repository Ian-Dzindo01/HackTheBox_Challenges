First let's try using gobuster and dirbuster on this website.
Gobuster doesn't seem to work, dirb doesn't find anything with the regular wordlist, but we're going to try the medium wordlist.

The challenge name might be giving us a hint to use something like wfuzz.

We found a /api directory inside of which there was an action.php.

Upon opening that file we see the following:

Error: Parameter not set.

Been stuck here for a while.

So now we need to find the GET parameter which will be used at this endpoint - found this online, whatever this means.

We are going to use wfuzz to find the required parameter. This is the command we are going to use:

wfuzz --hh=24 -c  -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt http://docker.hackthebox.eu:32087/api/action.php?FUZZ=test

We found that the keyword is reset. Upon opening the link with the reset keyword, we get this:

Error: Account ID not found.

Let's find the Account ID.

We are going to use this command to find the Account ID:

wfuzz --hh=27 -c  -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt http://docker.hackthebox.eu:32087/api/action.php?reset=FUZZ

Upon running this you will receive the flag!
